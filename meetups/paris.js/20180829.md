## [Build Advanced Search Experiences with a Custom Query Language](https://dtdg.co/advanced-search)

[A demo is also available](https://github.com/nioufe/advanced-search-demo)

First part was about building a great UX for researching things. It can become quite complicated when you think of 
kibana research as a form to fill. You will end up with tons of fields and it can be a nightmare to use.  
A great way is to use search queries. So the second part of the talk was about creating your own syntax to provide users
with a great search experience.  
The speaker presented [peg.js](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs) a tool to generate a parser from rules that you create 
yourself.  
Takeover : Better start with a simple syntax, and add new features after, but a simple parser is the best way to start.
Also, make lots of unit tests when implementing this.

**Personal notes:** A great talk that made me understand better why and how tools that provide great search have come
to that kind of UX and solutions.

## [Delivering Fast and Beautiful Images and Video](https://www.slideshare.net/dougsillars/parisjs-fastvideoandimages)

This talks gave some insights about how to improve performances when delivering pictures and videos through the web.
A great tool to try and use is [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/). There is also
[webpage test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) that can be used to test a live webpage on the internet.
Most affected users are mobile users as they have a limited CPU and a lower bandwidth than desktop users. So most of
optimisation have a really huge impact on mobile user experience.

### Quality

You often don't need the best quality picture to display on your website, you can reduce quality without having any visual
impact. Some Image and video management solutions (like cloudinary) provide some way to optimise automatically the 
quality of pictures.

### Format

A new format is arising [`webp` (mainly a google format)](https://caniuse.com/#search=webp). It is not currently 
supported by all browsers but it shows some pretty results in terms of data efficiency and loading time. I will keep an 
eye on this format.

### Sizing

We does not need to download a full 4k picture to display as a favicon... so yeah we should be careful at not giving a
too big picture to display in a really small area. It exists some [tools](https://github.com/cloudinary/responsive_breakpoints_generator) 
to automatically generate multiple pictures from one source for differents sizes.

### Lazy loading

A picture should be loaded when it is displayed. If it is outside the screen it does not need to be loaded as it will
slow down the page.

There was also a last part about video and streaming principles. How to search for the right quality for the bandwidth
and have at the same time a fast response time. If you are interested in that part, go read the slides !

## The Amazing Tale of the Web S01E03 - The Rise of JS :heart:

A great talk about the history of the web. How did we come to the state we are today and why javascript is rising.
It explained why the technical solutions evolved the way they are today, why we needed responsive design for example...
etc.  
That's a great talk and being the third and last part I would suggest to watch previous parts too on youtube
