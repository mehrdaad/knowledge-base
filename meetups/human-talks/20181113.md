# [HumanTalks Paris Novembre 2018](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/HumanTalks-Paris/events/256079042/)

The meetup is organized every second tuesday of every month in a lot of big cities. This one was in Paris.
You can find the videos of the talks on the [[FR] youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKFAwlgWiAB4vUpgnS63qog)

## Introduction to CQRS and Event Sourcing

This talk presented rapidly the main concept behind [CQRS](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and [Event 
sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) and why the two works well together.

**Personal thought:** 
CQRS and Event sourcing are really big subjects. Each one can be the subject of a talk to explain what is the purpose of
the solution and what are the main problems it tries to solve. Mixing the two in a talk that starts from zero is really
ambitious. The speaker could explain fairly well, but he broke the 10 min timing... 

## Mind-hijacking design :heart:

In 2018, time spent on social network is over 2 hours a day ! Applications understood long ago that it is better to steal
your time instead of asking for that. That talk presented what are the principles behind that and how applications force
their way into your life. It used real example like how infinite scroll where discovered and gained popularity.

**Personal thought:**
A really nice talk. We don't pay attention to some of the feature we produces. Sometimes, we just copy what other have
found to be working. But there are real principle behind that, backed by psychology and experiments. [Cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)
have been experimented and are used inside our applications to steal time.
It made me think about that [[FR] french youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/fauxsceptique) about cognitive 
bias. 

## Take back the control of your legacy with style

How to try to refactor your legacy when you don't really have control over it? When you don't really know the rules
behind the code and why it was written that way. When it is really big and identifying every impact is really hard.
This talk presented [scientist](https://github.com/github/scientist) : a tool that allow to make experiment in your code
and try it in production. It allows to propose a **candidate** to a **control** block and try it directly in production.
It generates reports about the execution time and differences in execution of the two blocks and allows to safely try
refactoring in production.  
The speaker also explained his experience with that tool and why he had to use it.

**Personal thought:** 
I discovered that tool. It has some limit to that tool. You cannot try something that have side effects (like sending an
e-mail for example). The good side is that it allows to run experiments directly in production with real data and with 
real users. I still think that library should be used wisely and should be the last way to refactor your code when
everything else failed.
